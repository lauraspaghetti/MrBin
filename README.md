# MrBin

This is my graduation project! I collaborated with an UX/UI designer from my school to create a web app that helps you treat and recycle waste. He handled the mockups and the HTML/CSS, while I developed the app using Symfony and React. 

You just need to enter the name or category of the waste you'd like to recycle, and Mr. Bin will show you how to properly handle it!

## For Common Types of Waste

Mr. Bin provides information about the type of waste you enter and tells you which bin it should go in. If you'd like to learn more about the bin or any other type of waste, the app will direct you to the category page. The category page lists all waste categories, including the types of waste that should go in the regular bins and the types that need to be processed at a facility.

## For Waste that Must Be Processed at a Facility

Some waste types need to be treated or recycled at a specialized facility. When you enter one of these types of waste, Mr. Bin will show you a list of facilities in your area that handle this waste. Each facility has a "Details" button, allowing you to view contact information, location, other types of waste they accept, and their opening hours.

## What's Next?

Currently, Mr. Bin covers only the City of Paris, but we're working on the next version, which will include additional cities. We are also expanding the list of waste types, so users will be able to find recycling solutions for virtually any type of waste.
