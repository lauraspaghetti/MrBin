# MrBin

This is my graduation project ! I collaborated with an UX/UI designer of my school to create a web app helping you to treat and recycle waste. He took care the mock-ups and of the HTML/CSS part and I've developped the app using Symfony and React. 
You just have to enter the name or the category of waste you'd like to recycle and Mr. Bin gives shows you how to take care of it ! 

## If it's a common type of waste 

It gives you information about the type of waste you entered and says in which bin you're supposed to put it. If you want to know more about this type of bin or about any other one, it leads you to the category page. The category page shows you all the categories of waste existing, the type of waste that should be taken care of in the usuals bins and the type of waste that has to be processed in a facility. 

## It it's a type of waste that has to be taken care of at a facility 

Some other types of waste need to be treated or recycled in a waste facility. When you enter a type of waste of this kind in the search engine, Mr. Bin shows you all the facilities in your town that take care of the type of waste entered. A "Details" button is added on every facility's sheet allowing you to know its contact, localization, the other type of waste they take care of and its opening hours. 

## What's next ? 

Mr. Bin only covers the City of Paris, but we are currently working on the next version and other cities will be added. We will also working with more types of waste, allowing the user to find how to take care of any type of waste possible.
